## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations

* Only authenticated users can create and share wishlists.
* All wishlists are public by default; private wishlist support is not implemented.
* User search or friend requests are not part of the MVP.
* Mobile responsiveness is supported but not fully optimized for all screen sizes.
* No email notifications or invitation links currently implemented.

---

## üìà Future Improvements

* Add wishlist privacy controls
* User search and collaboration features
* Mobile app version (React Native)
* Richer media support for wishlist items (images, links)
